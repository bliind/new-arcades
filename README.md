# Arcades

A multi-purpose MTG discord bot.

Originally created for a Scryfall search that allows the advanced parameters the website does.

This is achievable by putting card names in [[double brackets]] or by using the /scryfall command

Syntax such as `e:lea` or `cn:2` or `e:lea cn:2` is valid

You can prepend a search with:
- ! - Card Image
- @ - Art Crop Image
- \# - Format Legalities
- $ - Prices
- ? - Rulings

Now deck previews have been added when a URL for a decklist on Moxfield, Archidekt, or TappedOut are posted.

If the deck has more than 50 unique cards, a compact version will show with only 5 of each card type, but can be expanded to the full list in an ephemeral message ("only you can see this").

Next: You tell me!
